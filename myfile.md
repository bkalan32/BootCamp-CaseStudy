# Rise of Digital Lending

##  Overview and Origin


---

Upgrade was one of the main entities that thrived off this digital transformation. Founded in 2016 by Renaud Laplanche, who is also the founder of the lending marketplace LendingClub, the idea of Upgrade was founded based off all the knowledge the founder and his team gained from running LendingClub for 10 years (Lending Club was founded in 2006). Upgrade is modeled off LendingClub with just a few key differences. The founder stated that one of the changes he had to make was the relationship with borrowers. He had noticed that with LendingClub, the business was more transactional-based, basically stating that borrowers would come to their website, take a loan, and then poof, they're gone. With Upgrade, they wanted to make the relationship ongoing and more meaningful by giving value to the borrowers by giving them credit alerts and other credit content, which they named "credit health". The success of LendingClub made it very easy for the founder to receive funding. According to crunchbase.com, Upgrade has funded $587M in capital with a total of 7 funding rounds. The funding rounds consist of 2 Series A which took place on March 2, 2016, and March 13, 2017, with just 2 investors in 2016 and 9 investors in 2017. Then funding continued with a Series B in Feb of 2018, a Series C in August of the same year, a Series D in June of 2020, a Series E and Series F in August and November of 2021. Upgrade has a total of 47 investors.

## Business Activities:

In retrospect, Upgrade has built an online marketplace using modern technology that operates without a physical infrastructure, reducing operational costs and facilitating access to capital for borrowers and depositors, offering competitive interest rates on personal loans. Upgrade caters to customers who require quick and efficient capital access, but face challenges with traditional banks. To enable this, Upgrade uses advanced technologies like API deployment, Robotic Process Automation, AI, and Login Protection. Additionally, Upgrade has introduced blockchain technology into its credit card reward program, enabling customers to earn Bitcoin rewards.
## Landscape:

The Fintech industry's Lending domain features Upgrade as a significant player. Digital technology has experienced a gradual yet consistent growth over the past 5-10 years. The industry has moved away from traditional paper-based processes, and Docusign has emerged as a critical tool, enabling more efficient and cost-effective lending processes. Previously, loan decisions used to take longer, and paper checks were mailed, leading to further delays. In the current market, Upgrade faces competition from companies like Sofi, Credit Karma, and Nav, which provides comprehensive business and personal credit monitoring services.

## Results:

Upgrade has taken digital lending to the next level by introducing a lending marketplace and a credit monitoring platform. This innovation has had a significant impact on the business world, putting pressure on competitors who offer only one of these services to combine them while cutting out the middleman. Among the metrics digital lending platforms use to measure their success, loan volume is a key indicator, and Upgrade has processed over $1 billion in loans at one of the fastest rates. Additionally, the net promoter score is important as it measures customer satisfaction. With the implementation of credit health, over 99% of Upgrade's customers are signed up, with over 25% using the service monthly. The time to funding is another critical metric, and Upgrade delivers funds in minutes by approving a credit card or linking a bank account for instant deposits. Upgrade is currently outperforming most of its competitors, with a valuation of $10 billion in 2021, up from $1 billion.

## Recommendations

Upgrade's platform is very frictionless and easy to navigate, which is why I love using it. However, if I were to work with them, there are a few things I would add. Specifically, I would implement business credit monitoring and lending, which Nav currently has a monopoly on. By offering business credit lending and monitoring, Upgrade could attract half of the consumers who own a business because they would be able to manage both their personal and business credit scores in one platform. This product would require a new department focused on business credit and possibly new ML software and AI to collect business information. They could offer everything from business credit education to a monthly subscription that adds a tradeline to your business credit.
